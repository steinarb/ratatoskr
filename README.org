** Installing the ratatoskr application

First clone and build the sample application:
#+begin_example
  mkdir -p ~/git/
  cd ~/git/
  git clone https://github.com/steinarb/ratatoskr.git
  cd ~/git/ratatoskr/
  mvn install
#+end_example

Then give the following commands to the karaf console:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  feature:repo-add mvn:no.priv.bang.ratatoskr/karaf/LATEST/xml/features
  feature:install ratatoskr-with-derby
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then:
 1. open http://localhost:8181/ratatoskr in a web browser
 2. log in as user "jad" with password "1ad"
 3. click on counter and use "-" and "+" to change the value
 4. try editing the step size, wait a few seconds and then observe that "+" and "-" change the value with the step size
 5. Navigate to the top page and log out
 6. Log in as user "jod" with password "johnnyBoi" and observe that you end in a "not authorized page" (the user exists but do not have the role of the app)
 7. Log out and log back in as user "jad", navigate to the "counter" page, and observe that the count is like you left it (the count is persisted in the database)

** Configuring a new default locale

Out of the box, the sample application supports two locales: nb_NO (Norwegian bokm√•l) and en_GB (UK English).

The locale texts are provided by a Java resource bundle, and new languages can be added by adding them to the bundle and to the available locales returned by the RatatoskrService.

The default locale is nb_NO.

It is possible to persistently configuring the default locale to en_GB with the following commands in the karaf console command line:
#+begin_example
  config:edit no.priv.bang.ratatoskr.backend.RatatoskrServiceProvider
  config:property-set defaultlocale en_GB
  config:update
#+end_example

/Note/! The name of the config file will change when the package name and classname of the class changes in a new application based on this one, so adjust the command example accordingly.
